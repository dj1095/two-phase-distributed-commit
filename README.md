# Two-Phase Distributed Commit

## Overview

The Two-Phase Distributed Commit project is an implementation of the Two-Phase Commit protocol for distributed systems. This protocol ensures atomicity in distributed transactions, providing a reliable and fault-tolerant solution for coordinating transactions across multiple nodes.

## Features

- **Two-Phase Commit Protocol:** Implements the classic Two-Phase Commit protocol to ensure consistent and atomic distributed transactions.

- **Fault Tolerance:** Robust handling of failures and recoverability to maintain system integrity even in the presence of node failures.

- **Scalability:** Designed for scalability to accommodate a growing number of nodes, making it suitable for large-scale distributed systems.

- **Easy Integration:** Provides a simple and intuitive interface for integrating the Two-Phase Distributed Commit protocol into existing distributed systems.

## Getting Started

[Include instructions on how to install, configure, and run the project. Also, provide any prerequisites and dependencies.]

```bash
# Example commands to get started
git clone https://github.com/your-username/two-phase-distributed-commit.git
cd two-phase-distributed-commit
```

## Usage
```code
# Example usage in Python
from two_phase_commit import Coordinator, Participant

# Initialize coordinator and participants
coordinator = Coordinator("coordinator-host", 5000)
participant1 = Participant("participant1-host", 6000)
participant2 = Participant("participant2-host", 7000)

# Perform distributed transactions
coordinator.start_transaction()
coordinator.add_participant(participant1)
coordinator.add_participant(participant2)
coordinator.commit()
```
